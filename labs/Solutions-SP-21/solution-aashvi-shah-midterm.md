# Midterm Spring 2021

## Question 1
**Ubuntu is a free operating system, so there is no monetary investment required. It is a smart idea for the lab to upgrade to Ubuntu rather than purchasing new computers. The speed of current computers can be poor attributed to the reason that they have old processor. Ubuntu is well-known for its lightning-fast speed and excellent security safety. Hackers would find it difficult to gain access to your machines. From the moment you install Ubuntu, you will make it your own as it is customizable. The requirement for Ubuntu to work finely is RAM of a computer. The computer in the lab carries 2gb of RAM, which fits pretty fine to work with Ubuntu. Applications like c++, python, and web development need a lot of space, which Linux can easily provide. It's also simple to expand the available capacity by adding more disk space. Ubuntu is very convenient to use as it is user-friendly. For all this reasons, I can say that it is better to switch to Ubuntu rather than spending money in upgrading the machines.**

traditional exam is in the form of true or false questions and selects the right answer or short explanations
